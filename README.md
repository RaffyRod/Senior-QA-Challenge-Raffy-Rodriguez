# QA Automation Challenge

This is an automation framework developed for UI and API testing.


### UI testing

The framework contains the following 10 test cases for the website [automationpractice.com/](http://automationpractice.com/index.php) 

1. Sign up.

2. Log in.

3. Search for an item using the search bar.

4. Check the best seller's section.

5. Add an item to the wishlist.

7. Add an item to the shopping cart.

8. Remove the item from the shopping cart.

9. Complete the checkout.

10. Log out.
        


The test cases are documented in the test management platform [qatouch.com](https://www.qatouch.com/). To access the test suite, can reach me at:

### API testing 

For the API testing it was required to be automated 3 request to the Marvel Comics API [Marvel Developer Site](https://developer.marvel.com).

## Tech Stack

* [Javascript.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)
* [Nodejs.](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)
* [Cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress)
* [MD5.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5)
* [Fakerjs.](http://marak.github.io/faker.js/)
* [CircleCi.](https://circleci.com/developer/orbs/orb/cypress-io/cypress#quick-start)
* [Mochawesome.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mochawesome)


## Before Installing

* Node.js must be installed in order to run the project.

* If you are using `window's powershell or CMD` as terminal, go to the  `package.json`, in scripts section go to the command `clean:reports` and replace `rm -rf` with `rmdir /S /Q` in order to generate reports `(for locally purposes)`.

* Go to [Marvel's developer website](https://developer.marvel.com) and create an account to get a public and a private API key `(this is required for API testing)`.

* Make sure of getting an email and password for [automationpractice.com/](http://automationpractice.com/index.php).



## Installation

* Clone the repository from Github.

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/elraffy/Senior-QA-Challenge-Raffy-Rodriguez.git  
```

* Install all packages and dependencies for the project.

```bash
  npm install  
```


* Configure the credentials for UI and API:


#### UI testing configuration  
Go to directory `cypress/fixtures` , open the loginData.json file and add the email and password for the website.


```bash
  {
  "email": "myemail@mail.com",
  "pass": "mypassword"
   }
```

#### API testing configuration 


Go to directory `cypress/support/utilities` , open the file apiHelper.js and modify the properties `apiData.publicKey` and `apiData.privateKey`, 
replacing the values with the ones gotten from [Marvel's developer website](https://developer.marvel.com) after creating the account. 


```bash
    apiData.publicKey = "my marvel public key goes here";
    apiData.privateKey = "my marvel private key goes here";
``` 


The required hash and timestamp are being generated by using the [MD5 library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5) and programatically on the same apiHelper.js file.


```bash
   
   const date = new Date();
   apiData.timestamp = date.getTime();   

   apiData.hash = md5(apiData.timestamp + apiData.privateKey + apiData.publicKey);
```

* Run the tests using the cypress Test Runner by typing on the terminal the command:


```bash   
   npx cypress open
```


* Run the tests on headless mode by typing on the terminal the command:


```bash   
   npm run test
```

This will automatically run all test and generate the report at the end of execution.


## Must Know

* The website [automationpractice.com](http://automationpractice.com/index.php) has load issues and this make some of the test fail sometimes.
* For API negative test cases was used `failOnStatusCode: false` , so it can continue and do the assertions.


## Considerations

* It was used the POM dessign pattern combined with Javascript and cypress best practices.

* Reusable features like Login and Logout were created as a custom command for cypress, so can be used when need it.

* The static data was created on `fixture` but the dynamic data was generated using [fakerjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker), creating variables in a custom helper file.

* The CI pipeline is configured through a Circle CI orbs.
